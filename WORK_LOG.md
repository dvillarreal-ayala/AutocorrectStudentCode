Need to add more and change base cases, I'm not sure if they're correct right now |

Finished levenshteinDistance method and am working on the runTest method, should be finished with another hour of work. Once the tester file is finished, it can be tested and hopefully it works bc I will cry if not. |
| Mar 20  | 8:45-10pm | Mr. Blick was sick and so we used the class as a work period. I added some code to runTest to run my tests, and the code said I was returning the wrong strings since they weren't organized correctly. (weren't organized alphabetially in case of same levDist.). I made sure that the code I had written was at least sorting them correctly by levDist, and then edited some code I had written with an LLM to finish sorting the words alphabetically. AT the end of class, code currerntly passes all tests. |
