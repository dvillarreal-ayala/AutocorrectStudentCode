| Mar 14  |         |                                                                                                               Added more to notes and created the LevenshteinDistance method. Need to add more and change base cases, I'm not sure if they're correct right now |
| Mar 18  | 11-12pm | Cleaned up Autocorrect class and notes. Finished levenshteinDistance method and am working on the runTest method, should be finished with another hour of work. Once the tester file is finished, it can be tested and hopefully it works bc I will cry if not. |
