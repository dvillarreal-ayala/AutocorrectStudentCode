| Mar 11  |         |                                 Spent time thinking about the problem set and trying to think through different ways to solve while taking notes. |

| Mar 14  |         | Added more to notes and created the LevenshteinDistance method. Need to add more and change base cases, I'm not sure if they're correct right now |
