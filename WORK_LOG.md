Need to add more and change base cases, I'm not sure if they're correct right now |

Finished levenshteinDistance method and am working on the runTest method, should be finished with another hour of work. Once the tester file is finished, it can be tested and hopefully it works bc I will cry if not. |
| Mar 20  | 8:45-10pm | Mr. Blick was sick and so we used the class as a work period. I added some code to runTest to run my tests, and the code said I was returning the wrong strings since they weren't organized correctly. (weren't organized alphabetially in case of same levDist.). I made sure that the code I had written was at least sorting them correctly by levDist, and then edited some code I had written with an LLM to finish sorting the words alphabetically. AT the end of class, code currerntly passes all tests. |

After taking some time to think about how to approach it and taking notes, I talked with Mr. Blick who helped me create my main and run methods. |
| Mar 23  |  11-12pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I continued to work on the run() method and followed the outline Mr. Blick left for me. I changed threshold to 2 though because 2 prints out a lot of words already. It's currently an infinite loop, and I wanna ask Mr. Blick what I should change the condition to close the while loop to. |

I want it to be easier to use and look less messy. |
